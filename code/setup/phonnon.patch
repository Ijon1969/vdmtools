This appears to be due to changes in symbol export semantics. These are defined in src/3rdparty/phonon/phonon/objectdescriptionmodel.h:

/* Required to ensure template class vtables are exported on both symbian
and existing builds. */
#if (defined(Q_OS_SYMBIAN) && defined(Q_CC_RVCT)) || defined(Q_CC_CLANG)
// RVCT compiler (2.2.686) requires the export declaration to be on the class to export vtables
// MWC compiler works both ways
// GCCE compiler is unknown (it can't compile QtCore yet)
// Clang also requires the export declaration to be on the class to export vtables
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_EXPORT PHONON_EXPORT
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_EXPORT
#else
// Windows builds (at least) do not support export declaration on templated class
// But if you export a member function, the vtable is implicitly exported
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_EXPORT
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_EXPORT PHONON_EXPORT
#endif

This flaw can be fixed by changing the above code to this:

/* Required to ensure template class vtables are exported on both symbian
and existing builds. */
#if defined(Q_OS_SYMBIAN) && defined(Q_CC_RVCT)
// RVCT compiler (2.2.686) requires the export declaration to be on the class to export vtables
// MWC compiler works both ways
// GCCE compiler is unknown (it can't compile QtCore yet)
// Clang also requires the export declaration to be on the class to export vtables
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_EXPORT PHONON_EXPORT
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_EXPORT
#elif defined(Q_CC_CLANG)
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_EXPORT
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_EXPORT PHONON_EXPORT
#else
// Windows builds (at least) do not support export declaration on templated class
// But if you export a member function, the vtable is implicitly exported
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_EXPORT
#define PHONON_TEMPLATE_CLASS_MEMBER_EXPORT PHONON_EXPORT
#endif
